- Self Help

  - `help()`
  
  - error messages

    - Different kinds of resources (the problem is there are **too many** resources)
  
      - stackoverflow (general), github issues (mostly for error message), package website

        - rule of thumb:
          - check out unfamiliar functions: R help page
          - error messages: stackoverflow --> github issues (if package)
          - explore new package: github repo --> package website (find *tutorials*, or *getting started*) --> CRAN vignettes
          
          - studying or working?
          - expert or novice
          
          - if you want to **get things done quickly**: stackoverflow
            - alert: don't get addicted to stackoverflow
          - if you want to **learn** new things: package website (find *tutorials*, or *getting started*)
